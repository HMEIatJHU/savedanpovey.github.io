> The incident took place during a month-long sit-in by students who were protesting a bill that would allow Hopkins to create an armed campus police force, as well as the university’s contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
> 
> Povey said that he was frustrated by the protesters because they had taken over Garland Hall, the main administrative building on campus, which housed servers hosting his and several others’ research. The sit-in escalated on May 1, when students locked down the building, chained the doors shut, covered the windows and forced the administration building to close during the final week of the university’s spring semester.
> 
> The lockdown prompted the university to suspend or relocate services such as financial aid, academic advising and student visas.
> 
> Povey, a speech recognition researcher, said he was responsible for maintaining the servers for Hopkins’s Center for Language and Speech Processing, which were located inside Garland.
> After protesters locked down the building, Povey learned that it could take weeks before he could access the servers, according to a statement shared with the Sun. Meanwhile, two of the servers had failed, he wrote, and he was growing increasingly anxious about losing his and others’ research, which would affect the careers of both students and faculty.
> 
> But he also didn’t like the protesters’ politics.
> 
> Hours before Povey showed up with bolt cutters to break into Garland, he stood outside with signs that read, ''Enough With The Progressive [expletive],'' ''Don’t Make Me Tell Your Mom” and “Let us get back to work.''

> Around midnight on May 7, Daniel Povey, 43, led a break-in of Garland Hall in the middle of the night. 
> 
> ''Being frustrated as the prospect of a long siege at Garland where our computer servers live, I organized a group of what I called ''counter-protesters'' to try to regain control of the building from the students,'' Povey said in a statement. ''This was on the evening of May 8th; there was a scuffle and I was carried out of the building by the protesters. They then made allegations to the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE), saying that I had attacked them.
>
> In the statement released by Povey, he argued the protesters actually harmed and scratched him.

## The Investigation and Administrative Leave

> The OIE has been investigating the allegations that Povey engaged in violent and aggressive behavior during the incident at Garland Hall, as well as complaints that his conduct was racially motivated. The investigation from the OIE used a quote from Povey saying ''we were met with more violence than we anticipated,'' as an admission of guilt. During the lockdown of Garland Hall, seven protesters were arrested, four of them being students.
> 
> Povey was originally placed on administrative leave following the incident before being fired.

> Now Povey, who was initially placed on administrative leave, has been fired by Hopkins for jeopardizing student safety, according to an Aug. 8 letter written by Andrew S. Douglas, the university’s vice dean for faculty. Povey posted the termination letter online. It takes effect Aug. 31.
>
> Hopkins spokeswoman Karen Lancaster said the university could not comment on personnel matters but wrote in a statement that ''the safety, security, and protection of our students and others are of paramount importance to the University.''
> 
> She confirmed that a ''troubling incident'' in early May prompted an investigation and that in response to that incident, based on the ''undisputed facts of the case, the University took interim and now permanent action to ensure the safety and well-being of the community.''

> ''By your own admissions, your actions were premeditated and you expected that your actions could result in a violent confrontation with students and others in or around Garland Hall,'' the termination letter from Vice Dean for Faculty, Andrew Douglas stated. ''In fact, you believed the group of non-affiliates you brought with you could become violent. As a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University, you created a dangerous situation that could have ended in serious harm to our students, yourself, and others in the community.''
> 
> Hopkins spokesperson Karen Lancaster in a statement, ''the safety, security, and protection of our students and others are of paramount importance to the University. ''[based on the] undisputed facts of the case, the University took interim and now permanent action to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the community.”
>
> Povey also posted the termination letter online, which carries out on Aug. 31, to give students under him the time to find a new advisor.
>
> Povey argued that quote stemmed from him shrugging to lawyers after they asked if he was confident the non-affiliated group brought to Garland would be able to follow instructions no matter what happened.
> Povey’s termination letter states that he ''flagrantly and unapologetically violated JHU directives'' to stay away from the building and that he ''created a dangerous situation that could have ended in serious harm to our students, yourself, and others in the community.''
> 
> Povey wrote that he was the one who was hurt, suffering a scratch on his back during a skirmish with protesters.
