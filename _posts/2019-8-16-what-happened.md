> The incident took place during a month-long sit-in by students who were protesting a bill that would allow Hopkins to create an armed campus police force, as well as the university’s contracts with U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.
> 
> Povey said that he was frustrated by the protesters because they had taken over Garland Hall, the main administrative building on campus, which housed servers hosting his and several others’ research. The sit-in escalated on May 1, when students locked down the building, chained the doors shut, covered the windows and forced the administration building to close during the final week of the university’s spring semester.
> 
> The lockdown prompted the university to suspend or relocate services such as financial aid, academic advising and student visas.
> 
> Povey, a speech recognition researcher, said he was responsible for maintaining the servers for Hopkins’s Center for Language and Speech Processing, which were located inside Garland.
> After protesters locked down the building, Povey learned that it could take weeks before he could access the servers, according to a statement shared with the Sun. Meanwhile, two of the servers had failed, he wrote, and he was growing increasingly anxious about losing his and others’ research, which would affect the careers of both students and faculty.
> 
> But he also didn’t like the protesters’ politics.
> 
> Hours before Povey showed up with bolt cutters to break into Garland, he stood outside with signs that read, ''Enough With The Progressive [expletive],'' ''Don’t Make Me Tell Your Mom” and “Let us get back to work.''

> Around midnight on May 7, Daniel Povey, 43, led a break-in of Garland Hall in the middle of the night. 
> 
> ''Being frustrated as the prospect of a long siege at Garland where our computer servers live, I organized a group of what I called ''counter-protesters'' to try to regain control of the building from the students,'' Povey said in a statement. ''This was on the evening of May 8th; there was a scuffle and I was carried out of the building by the protesters. They then made allegations to the Office of Institutional Equity (OIE), saying that I had attacked them.
>
> In the statement released by Povey, he argued the protesters actually harmed and scratched him.

## The Investigation and Administrative Leave

[Fox News (August 10th)](https://www.foxnews.com/us/johns-hopkins-professor-fired-for-attempting-to-sabotage-student-protest)

> The OIE has been investigating the allegations that Povey engaged in violent and aggressive behavior during the incident at Garland Hall, as well as complaints that his conduct was racially motivated. The investigation from the OIE used a quote from Povey saying ''we were met with more violence than we anticipated,'' as an admission of guilt. During the lockdown of Garland Hall, seven protesters were arrested, four of them being students.
> 
> Povey was originally placed on administrative leave following the incident before being fired.

> Now Povey, who was initially placed on administrative leave, has been fired by Hopkins for jeopardizing student safety, according to an Aug. 8 letter written by Andrew S. Douglas, the university’s vice dean for faculty. Povey posted the termination letter online. It takes effect Aug. 31.
>
> Hopkins spokeswoman Karen Lancaster said the university could not comment on personnel matters but wrote in a statement that ''the safety, security, and protection of our students and others are of paramount importance to the University.''
> 
> She confirmed that a ''troubling incident'' in early May prompted an investigation and that in response to that incident, based on the ''undisputed facts of the case, the University took interim and now permanent action to ensure the safety and well-being of the community.''

[Fox News (August 10th)](https://www.foxnews.com/us/johns-hopkins-professor-fired-for-attempting-to-sabotage-student-protest)

> ''By your own admissions, your actions were premeditated and you expected that your actions could result in a violent confrontation with students and others in or around Garland Hall,'' the termination letter from Vice Dean for Faculty, Andrew Douglas stated. ''In fact, you believed the group of non-affiliates you brought with you could become violent. As a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University, you created a dangerous situation that could have ended in serious harm to our students, yourself, and others in the community.''
> 
> Hopkins spokesperson Karen Lancaster in a statement, ''the safety, security, and protection of our students and others are of paramount importance to the University. ''[based on the] undisputed facts of the case, the University took interim and now permanent action to ensure the safety and wellbeing of the community.”
>
> Povey also posted the termination letter online, which carries out on Aug. 31, to give students under him the time to find a new advisor.
>
> Povey argued that quote stemmed from him shrugging to lawyers after they asked if he was confident the non-affiliated group brought to Garland would be able to follow instructions no matter what happened.
> Povey’s termination letter states that he ''flagrantly and unapologetically violated JHU directives'' to stay away from the building and that he ''created a dangerous situation that could have ended in serious harm to our students, yourself, and others in the community.''
> 
> Povey wrote that he was the one who was hurt, suffering a scratch on his back during a skirmish with protesters.

[CNBC (August 12th)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/facebook-hires-daniel-povey-fired-johns-hopkins-professor.html)

> The school decided to fire Povey after a May incident in which he used bolt cutters to attempt to forcibly enter one of the school’s buildings that had been occupied by student protesters. The school notified Povey of his termination last Thursday, he says.
>
> ''As a faculty member at Johns Hopkins University, you created a dangerous situation that could have ended in serious harm to our students, yourself, and others in the community,'' reads a copy of the termination letter that Povey posted on his website.

## Facebook's Conditional Offer

[CNBC (August 12th)](https://www.cnbc.com/2019/08/12/facebook-hires-daniel-povey-fired-johns-hopkins-professor.html)

> Facebook confirmed on Monday that it has hired a speech recognition researcher who was fired this month from Johns Hopkins University after the university said he put students in danger while trying to enter a building occupied by protesters.
>
> A spokesman for the company told CNBC that it has hired Daniel Povey, who had been a research professor at Johns Hopkins since 2012, according to his LinkedIn profile. Before joining Johns Hopkins, Povey was a researcher at Microsoft as well as IBM.
> 
> Povey will work out of Facebook’s offices in Seattle starting on Aug. 19, according to his note. Povey said he will be working on speech recognition for Facebook and will report to Mike Seltzer, a Facebook applied research scientist.
> 
> Povey told CNBC he is hoping for the best in his new role, but would not be surprised if controversy follows him.
> 
> ''I just wouldn't expect to last very long at any big Silicon Valley company after expressing the kinds of opinions I have expressed in my leaving message,'' Povey said in an email.

## Povey's Declination to the Facebook Offer

[Baltimore Sun (August 18th)](https://www.baltimoresun.com/education/bs-md-johns-hopkins-professor-facebook-20190818-hb5ytjlmf5h7xa452jd7bkihce-story.html)

> A Johns Hopkins professor who was fired after he tried to use bolt cutters to force his way through a group of student protesters rallying against a private police force on campus has turned down a job at Facebook.
> 
> Daniel Povey, who was fired and banned from the Johns Hopkins University campus in Baltimore after he showed up to a May 8 student protest at Garland Hall with bolt cutters, wrote in an email he had turned down an offer at Facebook because he thought it was a disingenuous offer tied to his politics.
> 
> ''I believed that if they intended not to hire me, they would need an investigation to justify that decision — so as not to be accused of left-wing bias,” Povey wrote. “So I suspected that they might not have been intending to hire me full-time at all.''
> 
> A spokesperson for Facebook did not return calls for comment Sunday.
> 
> In the email, he continued his attacks against what he called ''progresive ideas,'' saying he was prepared for a similar culture at Facebook.
> 
> ''At orientation they make you state your gender pronouns when you introduce yourself; and they have tampons in the mens' restrooms,'' he wrote in the email. ''So it’s not a place where you can easily get away with opposing progresive ideas.''
> 
> He said he plans to work with an, as of now, unnamed Chinese company or university in speech recognition and machine learning.
> 
> But he added that the terms of employment have not been set and that ''almost certainly it will be one Chinese company or another.''
>
> ''There are several operations in the Seattle area who do this kind of thing, so I wouldn’t even have to move,'' Povey wrote. ''I will feel more relaxed among the Chinese because they don’t have American-style social justice warriors.''

> Povey, 43, also wrote a 1,600-word essay about what happened, along with a treatise about how he believes white men are discriminated against in ''this environment'' and how he is expected to act like a ''neutered puppy-dog.''

> ''I may not have my job,'' Povey concluded, ''but at least I still have my dignity and my independence of thought.''

> 
> ''White males in this environment seem to be expected to constantly atone for their existence by telegraphing their exclusive concern for every demographic group but their own, like a neutered puppy-dog or some Justin Trudeau man-child,'' Povey wrote. ''It’s pathetic, in my opinion; and I don’t accept it at all.''
> 
> In his goodbye note, Povey said he has many career options.
>
